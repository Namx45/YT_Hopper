Downloads youtube songs (by search query \ playlist \ text file)


~ When using make sure to change the desktop path
  its in the path function
  
~ In the path function there`s also a comment to force songs to be
  saved directly into a folder instead of the desktop path 
    WARNING! : once you create a folder using the script again will result in an error
               just delete the previous folder or change its name.
               
~ The script uses a file called songLIst.txt, when using it follow the same format
  written in the file if not the script wont work properly also make sure its in
  the same folder as the python script
  
~ Ive used a python package called pytube, to install it --> pip install pytube


Enjoy :)
